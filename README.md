# Platform Launch Analyzer ðŸš€

A comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating platform business ideas based on the Azoulay & Tucker framework. This tool helps entrepreneurs avoid "platform envy" by providing data-driven analysis of whether a platform strategy makes sense for their specific business idea.

## Overview

The Platform Launch Analyzer evaluates platform ideas across 6 critical dimensions to determine viability and provide strategic recommendations. It's designed to catch red flags early and guide strategic decision-making before significant resources are committed.

## Key Features

- **Quick Check (5-minute assessment)** - Rapid evaluation to identify critical red flags
- **Comprehensive Assessment** - Full evaluation across 6 key dimensions with detailed scoring
- **Smart Scoring System** - Numerical scores with specific feedback and recommendations
- **Multiple Usage Modes** - Interactive, batch processing, and JSON output
- **Decision Framework** - Clear go/no-go thresholds based on assessment scores

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/identity-wael/platform-launch-analyzer.git
cd platform-launch-analyzer

# No dependencies required - uses Python standard library only
# Requires Python 3.6+
```

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 scripts/quick_check.py
```
Answer 10 yes/no questions for immediate feedback on platform viability.

### 2. Full Interactive Assessment
```bash
python3 scripts/platform_assessment.py --interactive

### 3. Batch Assessment with JSON
```bash
python3 scripts/platform_assessment.py --input assets/example_airbnb.json
```
Process pre-filled assessments for multiple platform ideas.

## Assessment Framework

The analyzer evaluates platforms across 6 dimensions:

### 1. Core Definition (Coring)
- Clear identification of platform sides
- Well-defined value unit
- Designed core interaction
- Governance structure
- Control mechanisms

### 2. Network Effects Potential
- Same-side network effects strength
- Cross-side network effects strength
- Stand-alone value proposition

### 3. Seeding Strategy
- Marquee user attraction
- Subsidization approach
- Chicken-egg problem solution
- Single-side launch capability

### 4. Competitive Dynamics (Tipping)
- Multi-homing costs
- Differentiation from competitors
- User switching costs
- Winner-take-all potential

### 5. Value Creation
- Search cost reduction
- Transaction cost reduction
- Trust and safety mechanisms

### 6. Pricing Strategy
- Revenue model clarity
- Pricing side identification
- Pricing structure selection
- Long-term sustainability

## Scoring Interpretation

- **Green Light (>75%)**: Strong viability - proceed with confidence
- **Yellow Light (60-74%)**: Moderate viability - address weaknesses first
- **Red Light (<60%)**: Weak viability - reconsider platform approach

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Assessment
Perfect for evaluating a single platform idea with guided questions:
```bash
python3 scripts/platform_assessment.py --interactive
```

### JSON Batch Processing
Ideal for comparing multiple platform ideas:
```bash
# Create your assessment file based on template
cp assets/assessment_template.json my_platform.json
# Edit my_platform.json with your answers
python3 scripts/platform_assessment.py --input my_platform.json
```

### Generate JSON Report
For data analysis and tracking:
```bash
python3 scripts/platform_assessment.py --input data.json --format json --output report.json
```

## Real-World Example

The repository includes a real assessment of AirBnB's early-stage platform (circa 2008), demonstrating how a successful platform scores across all dimensions. Run it with:

```bash
python3 scripts/platform_assessment.py --input assets/example_airbnb.json
```

AirBnB scores 85.8% overall, with perfect scores in Core Definition, Value Creation, and Pricing Strategy.
